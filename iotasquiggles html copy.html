    <h3> Krasnogyarsk-26 - Jan. 25 2017 [I]</h3>
    <div ><p> The Russian closed town of Zheleznogorsk (or Krasnogyarsk-26 when the USSR kept it secret), is a town enveloped in the nuclear industry.
        It was established in the 1950s for the production of weapons-grade plutonium, and the nuclear facilities were built inside caves excavated into the
        mountain on the northern edge of the town were used during the original Soviet effort to split the atom. Their flag represents Krasnogyarsk-26
        quite well - it follows standard Communist design code, with a crimson background and an angular golden bear standing inside of an atom, clawing at an egg-shaped nucleus at its core. <br> <br> <a href="https://tedideas.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/zheleznogorsk-svg.png?w=770&h=513">Link</a>

    <h3> Desegnoj por eldono Esperanto de Harry Potter - Jan. 30 2017 [II] </h3>
    <p> I found an Esperanto translation of Philosopher's Stone on reddit, downloaded it, and decided I wanted to make some cover art-things for it.
    <br>
    <br>
    I found the artwork for my two favourite versions (the original UK children's edition and the new UK adult's edition), found a font both compatible with Esperanto's fudgy consonant
        circumflexes and looked sufficiently Potterish, ('Snell Roundhand') colored the text, italicized and overlayed it onto the originals.

    <h3>Twnga Website</h3>
    <p>This is a note that I have a new website, for my conlang Twnga. </p>


<!-- <h3> Why am I not i? - Feb. 04 2017 [III] </h3>
    <p> Originally, back in Middle English, the first person pronoun - <i>I</i>> -  was pronounced more like the German <i>ich</i>
        (and, by the way, was sometimes spelt '<i>ic</i>). But soon the lone <i>i</i>> became more common, and the only writers of the time - scribes - felt the
        the single letter looked small, and somewhat timid, and looked out of place in their illuminated manuscripts. So the writers began to make the word taller.
        The writers continued doing this until the 14th century, so when Chaucer learned to write in the late 14th century, he wrote with the word with a capital - as we still do today.
        <h5> (A sidenote - the only other accepted one-letter word in English is the indefinate article, <i>a</i>, which presumably didn't sneak into capitalisation because it is broad,
        even in its small form, and hence doesn't need to be enlarged.) </h5>

   <!-- <h3> Formatting/design/spelling on this blog = Feb. 08 2017 [IV] </h3>
     <p> This page is made by me with hypertext markup language and cascading stylesheet, both of which I have a scraping knowlege of. The colors were chosen because I like color: firebrick and color: gold goes well on it. I'm not a communist or anything like that.
        <br> <br>
    Also, the posts are written with Websterian spelling strandards, becuase it's better than the original British spelling. That said, I do mostly prefer British vocabularies and grammar over what might be considered regular in North American. Also, Colemak.

  <!--   <h3> u/Hellerick's Proposal for a New Australian Flag - Feb. 12 2017 [V] </h3>
   <p> I was browsing through the REDESIGNS section with the search term 'Australia' when I found a redesign by one 'Hellerick'. It was of the regular shape, with a horizontal split going across the flag at about 2/3 the way up. The upper third was yellow,
        the lower two were green, and a blue diamond shape stood just off centre, with a seven-pointed Commonwealth star inside of that.

                <br> <br>
Green and yellow are Australia's national colors, and the diamond is a representation of the Southern Cross, the constellation that helped Cook find Australia which is featured on the current Australian flag. The white star is the symbol of the commonwealth, which Australia is still a part of.

<!-- <h3> The Fabian Society - Feb. 16 2017 [VI] </h3>

   <p>  <b> <i>“For the right moment you must wait, as Fabius did most patiently, when warring against Hannibal,
        though many censured his delays; but when the time comes you must strike hard, as Fabius did, or your waiting will be in vain, and fruitless.”</i> </b>
        <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -The Fabian Society
        <br><br>
The Fabian society are a socialist group that believe in socialism via gradualist reforming, rather than the classic, glorious revolution that Marx originally envisioned. The Fabians
        were named by an early member after the Roman consul and dictator of Rome during the second war with Carthage, Fabius Maximus; a user of delay tactics (which, incidentally,
         made him unpopular with the Roman public, who called him <i>cuncator</i> - delayer), and the general that eventually triumphed over Hannibal by attrition rather than direct battle.

        <br><br>

        The Fabians lobbied for the introduction of a minimum wage in 1906, for the creation of a universal health care system in 1911 and for the abolition of hereditary
        peerages in 1917. The Society have also advocated eugenics — the practice of enforcing genetic selection - by sterilization.


        <br><br>

        In their early days, in 1900, the Society published <i>Fabianism and the Empire</i>, a statement of its views, drafted by Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw with suggestions by the  150 Fabian members. It claimed colonialism
        was an important part of internationalism, and said that Britain would end up either the centre of a world empire or two islands in the North Atlantic if they did not continue colonising.
The same pamphlet also promoted the creation of a citizen army over a professional army, and wanted to maintain the British armed forces in a high state of readiness to defend the Empire, and asked the Factory Acts
        extend the age for half-time employment to twenty-one, so that the citizen’s thirty hours could be used for “physical exercises, technical education, education in civil citizenship
        […] and field training in the use of modern weapons”.

        <br><br>

The society greatly influenced the Labour party when they took Government in 1997, advocating Bank of England Independence and a tax that raised £8 billion for NHS spending. Some other
        recommendations the society made, like a new cut-off point for income tax, were not accepted by Labour.

   <!-- <h3> Anglacized Ogham ADD PICS - Feb. 20 2017 [VII] </h3>

     <p>  Ogham <b> ['oːmˠ] </b>was a writing system used in ancient Ireland for writing Irish. <br><br> It was used in a similar way to the
        Nordic Futhark script and the letters were named after trees (willow, gorse, oak) and were written down-going-up or left-going-right.

        <br><br>

        The Old Irish alphabet only had 17 letters (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, I, l, m, n, o, r, s, t, u, - modern Irish has a ‘p’ to bring it to 18 characters)
        and so was obviously unsuitable for writing Modern English. Hence, I wrote an Anglicized Ogham alphabet. It has characters for a, b, d, e, f, g, i, j, k, l, m, n, o p, r, s, t, v, w, y, z, ŋ, ʃ and ð/θ.
